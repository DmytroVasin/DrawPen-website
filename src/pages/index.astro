      <article>
        <h3>1 · Install DrawPen</h3>
        <p>
          Download a build for your OS from GitHub Releases or install it using a package manager
          like Homebrew, Scoop or AUR.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>2 · Set your global shortcut</h3>
        <p>
          Open the settings, choose a comfortable global shortcut and customize drawing tools
          if you want to.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h3>3 · Press and draw</h3>
        <p>
          Press the shortcut anytime you share your screen. DrawPen appears on top of everything —
          you choose a tool and start drawing.

        <h3>4 · Hide with a single key</h3>
        <p>
          When you’re done, one shortcut hides all annotations and brings you back to a clean,
          distraction-free screen.

          DrawPen is a desktop app that runs locally on your machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn’t try to replace your presentation software — it just adds a simple
          annotation layer on top of whatever you’re already using.
        </p>
